  <!-- BAD WEBSITE -->
  <section>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com" target="_blank">Goodreads (Bad)</a></h3>
    <p>
      Goodreads is a social cataloging site where readers can track, review, and share books. 
      It allows users to build virtual bookshelves, connect with other readers, and explore 
      community features, though its design has often been critiqued as outdated and cluttered.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contrast:</strong> Book covers and headings stand out, but the site overall has low 
        visual hierarchy, and too much text competes for attention.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repetition:</strong> Some elements like book listings are consistent, but many parts 
        of the interface feel outdated and inconsistent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Alignment:</strong> While most content is grid-aligned, sidebars and content blocks 
        often feel crowded or misaligned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Proximity:</strong> Related book information is grouped, but many pages crowd 
        unrelated items together, leading to visual clutter.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- GOOD WEBSITE -->
  <section>
    <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon (Good)</a></h3>
    <p>
      Amazon is a widely used e-commerce platform known for its extensive catalog of products, 
      personalized recommendations, and efficient shopping experience. Its layout is designed to 
      guide users quickly toward purchases and product comparisons.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contrast:</strong> Amazon uses strong color contrast (such as yellow buttons against white or dark 
        backgrounds) to draw attention to key actions like “Add to Cart.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repetition:</strong> Typography, buttons, product cards, and navigation structure remain consistent 
        throughout the site, helping users recognize patterns and navigate efficiently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Alignment:</strong> Product listings, search results, and menus are cleanly aligned in grid layouts, 
        making the site easy to scan and visually structured.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Proximity:</strong> Product images, titles, prices, and ratings are grouped tightly, which helps the 
        user compare items quickly without confusion.
      </li>
    </ul>
