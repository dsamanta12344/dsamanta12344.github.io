      <p>
        Goodreads is a social cataloging site where readers can track, review, and share books. 
        It allows users to build virtual bookshelves, connect with other readers, and explore 
        community features, though its design has often been critiqued as outdated and cluttered.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong> Book covers and headings stand out, but the site overall has low 
          visual hierarchy, too much text competes for attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repetition:</strong> Core elements like book listings and shelves are consistently styled, 
          but some sections feel inconsistent and dated, reducing unity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alignment:</strong> Many elements are arranged in grids or columns, but some pages feel cramped 
          and misaligned, especially with sidebars and crowded content blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proximity:</strong> Book title, author, and rating are grouped well, but on busier pages 
          related and unrelated items are often crammed together, creating clutter.
